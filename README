CPANPLUS::Shell::Curses is a graphical user interface bases
on Curses::UI to the newly developed CPANPLUS package.

It makes it more comfortable to access the CPAN but
it is still possible to access the shell through a terminal
connection.

Features:
	- List of all CPAN packages
	- Searching as in the default shell
	- Upgrading/Uninstalling packages
	- Nice and fency Curses interface
	- almost as many keybindings as emacs (TM) :-)
